            Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock 
            band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied 
            by the double A-side single "Eleanor Rigby" / "Yellow Submarine". 
            The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their 
            retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt 
            use of studio technology to date, building on the advances of their l
            ate 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since become regarded as one of 
            the greatest albums in popular music, with recognition centred on its 
            range of musical styles, diverse sounds, and lyrical content.
The Beatles recorded Revolver after taking a three-month break at the start of 1966, 
and during a period when London was feted as the era's cultural capital. The songs reflect 
the group's interest in the drug LSD, Eastern philosophy and the avant-garde, lyrically addressing 
themes such as death and transcendence from material concerns. With no thoughts of reproducing their n
ew material in concert, the band made liberal use of automatic double tracking, varispeed, reversed 
tapes, close audio miking, and instruments outside of their standard live set-up.
