            Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album by English rock band the Beatles, 
            released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records. The recording sessions were the last in which
             all four Beatles participated. Let It Be was the final album that the Beatles completed and 
             released before the band's dissolution in April 1970, but most of the album had been recorded 
             before the Abbey Road sessions began.The two-sided hit single from the album, "Something" backed 
             with "Come Together", was released in October and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.
            Abbey Road incorporates genres such as blues, pop and progressive rock, and makes prominent use of the Moog 
            synthesizer and the Leslie speaker. Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited together to form 
            a single piece. The album was recorded amid a more enjoyable atmosphere than the Get Back/Let It Be sessions 
            earlier in the year, but there were still frequent disagreements within the band. John Lennon had privately 
            left the group by the time that the album was released, and Paul McCartney publicly quit the following year.
